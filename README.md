# WebGL Tutorial project

<p>
WebGL is an API which runs on OpenGL allowing computer graphics to be rendered on a HTML canvas
<br>
This project is going to contain all the code regarding the usage of WebGL
and how it can be applied to designing unique portfolio websites
<br>
Learn something new and cool today!
<br>
You can follow the instructions in <a href="#Getting Started"></a> alongside to learn aswell
</p>

# Getting Started

<h2>Setting up your environment</h2>
<p>
You want to have Visual Studio Code to be install first 
via <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>
<br>

Once downloaded and installed open your Git bash or terminal
<br>

Don't type the [ ] square brackets, type the letters <strong>inside only</strong>
<br>

Type [cd Desktop], "cd" means you are changing directories (folders)
<br>

Create a directory (folder) named "WebGLTutorial" using [mkdir WebGLTutorial]
<br>

Next enter that folder using [cd WebGLTutorial] and create a html file called "index.html"
using [code index.html]

<br>
This will bring up VsCode with your file and save it
</p>
<br>

<h2>Main files to view</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">HTML file</a></li>
    <li><a href="javascript.js">Javascript file</a></li>
    <li><a href="Css.css">CSS file</a></li>
</ul>
When viewing these files the majority of code will be found in the javascript file
<br>
Don't worry about the length of code that is present, all will be explained
</p>
<br>

# Documentation

<p>
Documentation is filled within this tutorial project including versions and author comments
<br>

The files are commented on each step to allow you to understand the code better
<br>

The comments will give a good amount of explanation for what the code's scope is
<br>

Other comments may just be optional code when expressed
</p>

# What is WebGL?

<p>
WebGL is a web-based API which runs on the OpenGL API (Application Programming Interface)
<br>

You can create computer graphics in the form of:
<ul>
    <li>2D Graphics</li>
    <li>3D Graphics</li>
    <li>Animations</li>
    <li>Games</li>
</ul>
It is good to note that WebGL does not need the installation of plug-ins.
<br>

There are endless possiblities to create and design unique artifacts
<br>
